# Arduino_communication

**Work in progress**

How to make arduino cards communicate with other programms or with each other using :
- serial (usb + bluetooth serial)
- wifi 
- ble 
- infra red

The motto is analogIN <=> digitalOut

Boads targetted : 
- Arduino Uno wifi rev2 / Arduino Nano iot 33 (ble)
- Feather Huzzah 8266 (wifi => only one analog in)
- Feather Esp32 (wifi + ble)
- Sparkfun ESP32 Thing (wifi + ble)

Programs targetted :
- Processing
- p5js
- cablesgl
- Touch Designer
- Unity
- Unreal ?
